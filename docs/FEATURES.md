# 🚀 Features & Capabilities

## 1. Generative Ecosystem Mapping
Instead of querying a static database, EcoWeb generates unique graphs on demand.
-   **Inputs:** Any natural ecosystem (e.g., "Tide Pool"), concept (e.g., "Carbon Cycle"), or specific location (e.g., "Yellowstone").
-   **Classification:**
    -   **Fundamental Nodes:** Large, ringed nodes representing foundations (Sun, Water, Producers).
    -   **Derived Nodes:** Standard nodes representing consumers or dependents.

## 2. Interactive Physics Engine
Users can physically manipulate the data to understand clusters.
-   **Draggable Nodes:** Nodes react to drag gestures.
-   **Jolt/Shake:** A "Zap" button creates a kinetic impulse to unstick clustered nodes.
-   **Zoom/Pan:** Infinite canvas navigation.

## 3. Impact Simulation (The "What If?" Engine)
Allows users to visualize the fragility of ecosystems.
-   **Action:** Removing a node simulates an extinction event.
-   **Logic:** The system calculates Trophic Cascades.
    -   *Predator Removal* -> Prey Overpopulation (Thriving).
    -   *Prey/Producer Removal* -> Predator Starvation (Endangered/Extinct).

## 4. Field Research Assistant
Enables the addition of external concepts to an existing graph.
-   **Use Case:** A user sees a graph of a "Forest" and asks, "How do *Humans* fit here?"
-   **Process:** The AI analyzes the *existing* nodes and creates new links specifically connecting the external concept to the current view.

## 5. Pathfinding Mode
Visualizes the shortest ecological chain between two entities.
-   **Algorithm:** Breadth-First Search (BFS).
-   **Visuals:** Highlights the specific nodes and links in the chain, dimming the rest of the graph.

## 6. Note Visualization (NLP to Graph)
Converts unstructured text into a structured network.
-   **Input:** Users paste study notes or articles.
-   **Output:** A graph representing the entities and relationships described in the text.
